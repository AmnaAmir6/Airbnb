#Airbnb HomePage

This project is a simplified clone of the Airbnb homepage, built with React and other supporting libraries for enhanced UI. The homepage allows users to explore different property categories (e.g., Beachfront, Luxury) by clicking on the icons. It dynamically fetches property listings, and users can filter listings by category. This project uses Tailwind CSS for layout and styling.
